    "### Convert The Job Schedualing To QAOA\n",
    "This project is undertaken for the NYU Quantum Computing Hackathon represents an innovative intersection of quantum computing technology and environmental science, specifically targeting the problem of desertification. Desertification is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, primarily caused by various factors including climate change and human activities such as deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and water misuse. To better monitor and predict patterns of desertification, the project utilizes a quantum computing approach, complemented by classical machine learning techniques."

    "1. **Data Sets**: The data sets for this project are derived from an analysis focused on desertification in Iraq, incorporating resources like the work conducted by Omdena on using machine learning and satellite data for desertification detection. The data sets include measurements and indices from satellite imagery, primarily focusing on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), along with other relevant environmental indicators.\n",

    "### Classical Machine Learning Models\n",
    "2. **Classical Analysis**: Initially, the project employs classical machine learning models such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models are applied to subsets of environmental factors, specifically NVDI and LST, to establish baseline desertification predictions and to understand the influence of each individual factor on the desertification process.\n"

    "\n",
    "Putting constraints is a key aspect of ensuring the integrity of the execution and optimizing the scheduling of jobs. By enforcing that each job must be assigned to exactly one timeslot and only one job can be assigned to each timeslot, collisions are prevented, maintaining execution integrity. These constraints also aid in minimizing the total execution time by encouraging even distribution of workload across timeslots and efficient resource utilization. As a result, the scheduling algorithm can find solutions that optimize execution duration, enhancing efficiency and productivity."
